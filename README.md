Iconostasis is an audio-reactive piece created using the p5.js library.\

This work uses the rose curve geometry. This geometry was discovered, and explored, by the Italian
mathematician Guido Grandi between 1723 and 1728 [1]. The polar equation is generally given as:\
\
$r = asin(n\theta)$
\
\
The variable “n” controls the number of “petals” of the resultant curve, whereas the value “a” controls the radius of these petals. This piece explores high values of n: Between 500 and 1000. High values of “a” are used, revealing geometric patterns at the very centre of these rose curves which typically remain unseen. Incrementing “n” with low values causes a perceived rotation as the curve moves through different configurations.

The sound is taken from a jam with a sequencer I built in Pure Data. A combination of clicks and bursts of white noise are used to create generative rhythms.
